# Getting started

HackedServer is a multi-platform Minecraft plugin that detects Forge mods, Fabric mods, hacked clients, and other modified clients. It alerts your staff and can automatically punish cheaters.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft Server**: 1.18 or newer ([Paper](https://mcserverjars.com/paper), [Spigot](https://mcserverjars.com/spigot), or similar)
- **Java**: 17 or newer
- **ProtocolLib**: Required for Spigot/Paper servers
- **PacketEvents**: Required for Velocity proxy

Download server software from [MCServerJars.com](https://mcserverjars.com).

<Callout type="info">
HackedServer 3.x is a complete rewrite with simplified installation — no external dependencies like HackedCore are required anymore.
</Callout>

## Installation

### Installing on Spigot/Paper

1. Download and install [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to your `/plugins/` folder
2. Download `HackedServer.jar` and place it in your `/plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server

<Callout type="info">
HackedServer has been tested with Spigot, CraftBukkit, PaperMC, Purpur, and other popular forks.

### Installing on BungeeCord

Start by installing HackedServer on every Spigot server as explained in the Spigot/Paper tab.

Make sure that:
- `bungeecord` is set to `true` in your `spigot.yml` on each backend server
- `ip_forward` is enabled in your BungeeCord `config.yml`

Then:
1. Download `HackedServer.jar` (same JAR as for Spigot)
2. Place it in your BungeeCord `/plugins/` folder
3. Restart your proxy

If you are using a fork like Waterfall or Travertine, you may need to adjust configuration settings for optimal compatibility.

### Installing on Velocity

HackedServer supports Velocity proxy for detecting modified clients across your network.

**Requirements:**
- [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) installed on your Velocity proxy

**Installation:**
1. Install PacketEvents on your Velocity proxy
2. Download `HackedServer.jar` and place it in your Velocity `/plugins/` folder
3. Restart your proxy

<Callout type="info">
Velocity provides modern proxy features with better performance. HackedServer fully supports Velocity's API for seamless integration.

## Configuration Files

After the first run, HackedServer will generate configuration files in the plugin folder:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config.toml` | Main settings (language, debug mode) |
| `actions.toml` | Define actions triggered by detections |
| `generic.toml` | Configure client/mod detection rules |
| `languages/english.toml` | Message translations |

See the [Configuration](/configuration) page for detailed documentation.

## Quick Start

Once installed, HackedServer will automatically start detecting modified clients. Staff with the `hackedserver.alert` permission will receive alerts when players join with detected mods or clients.

Use `/hs help` to see available commands, or check the [Commands & Permissions](/commands-and-permissions) page for details.
